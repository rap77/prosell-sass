# Canonical Writer Agent

**Purpose:** Optional enrichment path. Read a project's existing context and produce a fully populated canonical document — replacing every template placeholder with synthesized real content.

**Input:** A JSON payload from `context-to-canonical-handler.py --payload-only` containing:

- `doc_type` — type of canonical doc to produce
- `target` — absolute path to the source project
- `output_path` — where to write the output file
- `template_content` — the template structure to follow
- `example_content` — a filled example for reference
- `context` — collected project signals (files content, stack, git log)

**Output:** A single populated canonical `.md` file written to `output_path`.

> Note: the handler already supports direct-write mode. Use this agent only when
> you want richer model-authored synthesis.

## Mission

Transform what a project already has into a structured canonical document.

Do not copy placeholder text into the output.
Do not invent facts not evidenced by the context.
Do not leave any section empty — synthesize from what is available, mark uncertain items clearly.

---

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Parse the payload

Extract from the JSON payload:

- `output_path` — the file to write
- `template_content` — structure to follow
- `example_content` — reference for tone and depth
- `context.content` — dict of source texts keyed by type
- `context.project_name` — project name
- `context.stack` — detected stack

### Step 2 — Read additional context if needed

The payload contains pre-read content in `context.content`. Use it directly.

If a section requires detail not in the payload, read the file from `context.target`:

- `README.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/PRD/*.md` (first few)
- `package.json`

Do not read more than necessary. The payload content is the primary source.

### Step 3 — Synthesize each section

For each section of the template, use the field mapping for the active `doc_type`.

#### doc_type: project-adapter

| Template section           | Primary source                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Identity           | `project_name`, `claude_md`, `readme`               |
| Project Goal               | `readme`, `claude_md`, `docs_prd`                   |
| Why MasterMind             | `mastermind_config`, `claude_md`                    |
| Constraints                | `claude_md`, `readme`, `docs_prd`                   |
| Selected Brains            | `mastermind_config` → `brains.active`               |
| Project-Specific Knowledge | `claude_md` (Key Design Decisions, Language, Stack) |
| Local Integrations         | `package_json`, `pyproject_toml`, `claude_md`       |
| Decision Model             | `claude_md`, `docs_prd`                             |
| Memory Boundaries          | synthesize from all sources                         |
| Success Criteria           | `readme`, `docs_prd`, `claude_md`                   |

#### doc_type: objective

| Template section    | Primary source                                                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective Identity  | `objective_name`, `objective_slug`, `objective_intent`, `project_name`                       |
| Summary             | synthesize from `objective_name` + `claude_md` + `readme` — one sentence                     |
| Why It Matters      | `docs_prd`, `claude_md`, `readme` — product + technical + user impact                        |
| Scope               | synthesize from `objective_name` + project patterns — be specific about what is NOT included |
| Acceptance Criteria | derive from `objective_name` + `objective_intent` + project conventions — concrete, testable |
| MVP Relevance       | `handoff`, `roadmap` — check if similar objective is active/done                             |
| Dependencies        | `roadmap` (existing objectives), `canonical_index`                                           |
| Technical Context   | `stack`, `claude_md`, `docs_prd` — affected modules, approach, constraints                   |
| Evidence            | `files_found` — list actual source docs read                                                 |

**For objective docs, the `<!-- mm:objective-spec -->` comment line MUST be populated:**

```
<!-- mm:objective-spec | slug: {objective_slug} | intent: {objective_intent} | status: draft -->
```

This marker is what allows `/mm:discover` to reliably identify and parse this file as an objective candidate.

Write real content for each field — no angle-bracket placeholders, no "TBD".
If a field has no evidence, write: `(not documented — to be defined)`
Preserve the template section headers exactly.

### Step 4 — Write the output file

Create parent directory if needed.
Write the populated document to `output_path`.

### Step 5 — Report

Print:

```
STATUS: written
FILE: <output_path>
SECTIONS: <count of non-empty sections>
```

## Quality rules

- Every section must have at least one concrete sentence derived from the project context.
- The document must be readable standalone — no references to "the payload" or "the template".
- Stack technical details (e.g. Next.js, FastAPI, Rust) must appear where relevant.
- Brains listed must match `mastermind_config` if present; otherwise infer from project type.
- The tone should match the example: direct, specific, no marketing language.

## Output format

Follow the template structure section by section.
Add a footer at the end:
