## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Playwright is the PRIMARY publisher (immediate). Graph API is secondary (post FB App Review).
- Posts expire every 7 days — auto-republication is P0.
- Catálogo público is Phase B (post-MVP) — validate internal flow first.
- Appointment entity owned (no Calendly) — ROI traceability, future ML.
- PUBLISH-08 (AI titles) deferred to Phase 7 (needs CarGurus data volume first).
- Phase 4 (Leads) depends on Phase 1 (requires active listings to capture leads against).
- Phase 6 (Market Intelligence) depends on Phase 3 (needs scraped CarGurus data).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CONCERN: tenant_id=None for OAuth-created users blocks full multi-tenancy. Fix scoped to Phase 2 (before catalog roles are enforced).
- CONCERN: Auth endpoints lack rate limiting — must fix before production deploy (pre-Phase 5).
- CONCERN: SendGrid not wired — needed for APPT-03 (dealer email notifications) in Phase 4.
- CONCERN: FB App Review for Graph API publishing may be pending during Phase 1 — Playwright fallback is the plan.
