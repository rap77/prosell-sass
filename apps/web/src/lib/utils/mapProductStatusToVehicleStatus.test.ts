/**
 * mapProductStatusToVehicleStatus — Subsystem A (Generic ProductCard).
 *
 * Pins the runtime mapping from `Product.status` (8 domain literals) to
 * `VehicleStatus` (8 display literals that the `StatusBadge` understands).
 * The shape mismatch is by design: `Product.status` is the workflow state
 * the backend cares about; `VehicleStatus` is the visual vocabulary the
 * legacy `StatusBadge` ships with. Subsystem A introduced this util so the
 * generic card can pass `product.status` through the existing badge.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - Total: every `Product.status` literal maps to a `VehicleStatus`.
 *     A missing entry must surface as a TypeScript error (the impl
 *     declares `satisfies Record<Product["status"], VehicleStatus>`).
 *   - Stable: existing `Product.status` literals whose value already
 *     exists in `VehicleStatus` (draft / pending / published / sold /
 *     reserved) are pass-through. The 3 remaining workflow-only literals
 *     (paused / rejected / archived) collapse to the nearest existing
 *     display slot.
 *   - Safe: a malformed `Product.status` (defensive — should never happen
 *     but the type union is not sealed) is handled by the catch-all.
